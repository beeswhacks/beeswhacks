- 👋 Hi, I’m @beeswhacks.
- 👔 Professionally, I'm a data analyst. I work with data on higher education in England, primarily on surveys of the student experience and HE finance. I use SAS and SQL mostly, although I'm learning to use Python and R via Databricks.
- 👨‍💻 Privately, I enjoy programming for enjoyment's sake.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and JavaScript.
- 📫 Reach me at je.preston20@gmail.com. I'm on Twitter @beeswhacks but I don't check it very often.
